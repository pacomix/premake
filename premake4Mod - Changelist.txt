== Premake4Mod ==
*Premake4Mod is the name given to the tool resulting of the whole changes applied to the original Premake v4.3 tool. This is the used tool to generate the solution/project files at Trinigy.
*Maybe the name will be changed to Trimake in order to not get confused with the original Premake executable that is still needed to generate Premake4Mod from the modified source code.
